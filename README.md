**CLICK ON Godot Engine!!**

```
start downloading it now as I am going to start yapping (WARNING)
```

**Regular**: GDScript, C++, VisualScript; full capabilities
**.NET**     : C#; Limited capabilities, (Made for unity fools)

```
Basically the .NET is for Unity people who use C#,
while the regular engine is for everyone else
```


```
The problem is, sometimes (ns), Unity will make a scary decision where they will decide you don't get any money anymore.

Discuss Unity runtime fee and why it caused people to change over to Godot (As it was similar to Unity) [reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/16he67l/so_i_did_some_math_on_the_unity_runtime_fee_and/)

```
Although they did roll this change back it made people really nervous that at any point Unity and other game engine developers would take all of their money, which is very important to a small and large game studios.

Anyways, this scared some developers and they moved to Godot. This is because it had the one feature that basically made it Unity .5 and the fact that it is completely free and open source.

Well its pronounced gah-dough and it lets you make 2d AND 3d games. It also allows you to export to Windows, Linux, AND MacOS. Like... whens the last time you've seen a VIDEO GAME work on MAC? Anyways it also exports to IOS and Android. So fair warning, anything you make will be made fun of for (ns) being a mobile game.
